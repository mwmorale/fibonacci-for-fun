Welcome to fibonacci-for-fun !

My GitHub is python-heavy, so I thought that it would be a smart decission to show off some of my 
Java skills and C++ skills and Python skills! Here, I am replicating the sacred "Fibonacci Sequence" 
with all 3 of the mentioned languages using recursion... thats right - recursion.
